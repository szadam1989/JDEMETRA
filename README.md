# JDEMETRA
In 2021 I modified the ODbConnector-master plugin, which I received from Charles Philippe to insert result data into Oracle database through JDBC Connection.
I also uploaded the received plugin .zip folder, which I modified some source codes in.

Here are the JDEMETRA+ source codes (I did not write any files among them):
